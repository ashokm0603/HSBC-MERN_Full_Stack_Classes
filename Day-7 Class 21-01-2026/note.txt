->Mocha 
    ->liveScript
            ->javascript   (net scape)
    
    1996->ECMA 
            ->added new features ->release ES1 ->1996

            ->stable version Javascript is ES6 (ECMA Script)
            ->latest version Javascript is ES15(ECMA Script version 15)


Javascript : 
------------
        ->Javascript Is the Scripting Language as well as programming Language
        ->Javascript is Declarative In Nature 


        ->Using Javascript we can dynamic Web application
        ->Using Javascript We can add functionality to the web pages
        ->Using JS we can fetch the API data to server
        ->Using Js achieve DOM functionality


        ->Javascript having single Call stack



    We can write JS in two way : 
    ----------------------------
            1. internal JS 
                    ->Write entire JS code in html by taking <script></script> in body section




            2. external JS 
                    ->Write entire JS code by creating .JS file and link to html  by taking <script></script>  in body section
                  

            

DataTypes in Javascript : 
--------------------------
    ->DataTypes represents the What type of Data we are storing on variable

    1. Primitive DataTypes (object referencing)
            i.      string 
            ii .    number 
            iii.    boolean 
            iv.     null 
            v.      undefine 
            vi.     bigInt
            vii.    symbol



    2. non Primitive DataTypes(object de-referencing)
            i.   Arrays 
            ii.  objects
            iii. functions
            iv.  class

    

    Variables : 
    -----------
        ->variable are the named memory location used to store data/ values and it can change N number of time during execution

        or 

        ->variables are the containers used to store data/ values 


        1. variable Declaration
                ->naming or defining a variable
                    let num;
        2. variable initialization 
                ->assigning/ storing a values to the variable

        3. variable utilization 
                ->accessing/ using a variable is called as  a variable utilization

        4. variable Re-initialization 
                ->Re-assigning/ Re-storing a values to the variable





hosting / Temporal dead lock
-----------------------------
        ->utilizing the variables before Declaration


        Ex:     console.log(var1)
                    let var1=50;
    
    
        1. let 
                ->let variables acts like local scop
                ->Declaration/ initialization in same or different is possible
                ->Re-initialization is possible but Re-Declaration is not possible 
                ->We can not hosting let variables 

        2. var

                ->let variables acts like scrip scop
                ->Declaration/ initialization in same or different is possible
                ->Re-initialization /Re-Declaration  is possible  
                ->We can  hosting var variables 

        3. const 
                ->const variables acts like final (we can not change values)
                ->Declaration & initialization in same line but in different line is not possible
                ->Re-initialization /Re-Declaration  is not possible  
                ->We can not hosting const variables 



    Tokens : 
    --------
        ->Tokens are the smallest Units in the program / code 

        Types of Tokens 
        ------------------
            1. Identifiers 
                ->names given javascript code 
                ->in the place of Identifiers we can not use keywords


            2. keywords : 
                    -> keywords are pre-define word
                    ->66 keywords     /   C->32 / python ->34 /java ->50 / Dart 62


            3. literals 
                ->Values give to the code 
                1. string literals 
                2. Numeric literals


            4. operators 
                    ->operators are the symbols used to perform operation on operands

                    Ex: 10 + 20 
                    Types : 
                        1. Athematic operators                       (+, - , * , %  , / , **)
                        2. comparison operators                      (== , != ,===)
                        3. Assignment operators                      (=, += , -=, *=, /=,%=)
                        4. logical operators                         (&& , || , ! )
                        5. shift operators                           (>> , <<)
                        6. bitwise operators                         (& , | , ^)  
                        7. ternary operators                         (condition ? true statement : false statement ) 
                        8. Relational operators                       (> ,< ,>= ,<=)    
                        9. unary operators                             (++ , --)  



            5. separators 
                    ->separators are used to separate the give code 
                    Ex: "" ,' ' ,`` ,() ,[ ], {} , < >  , : ,;

        String : 
        ---------
            ->we can Declared string 3 different ways 
            1. "    " 
            2. '    '
            3. `     `->back tick ->template string -> we achieve string interpolation
